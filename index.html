    <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p> I studied at the University of Aberdeen and gained an MA in Film and Visual Culture.
        Following my graduation, I began a career in childcare and attained an SVQ Level 3 in Social Services (Children and Young People).
       In ten years of working with young children, I developed a keen passion for children's photography and found great joy in capturing each child's individuality.</p>
